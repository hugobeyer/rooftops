General Behavior
Make suggestions and provide explanations for code changes, but DO NOT automatically implement them
Wait for explicit confirmation before applying any code changes
When showing code examples, treat them as references only - they should not trigger automatic implementation
Offer specific and actionable advice but prioritize explanation over direct code modification
If you have different ways of doing same behavior that was asked, please tell me first.
