# Cursor Rules for AI Assistance

## General Behavior
- Make suggestions and provide explanations for code changes, but DO NOT automatically implement them
- Wait for explicit confirmation before applying any code changes
- When showing code examples, treat them as references only - they should not trigger automatic implementation
- Offer specific and actionable advice but prioritize explanation over direct code modification
- If you have different ways of doing same behavior that was asked, please tell me first.

## Code Suggestions
- Present code suggestions as examples rather than as commands to be executed immediately
- Use phrases like "consider this approach" or "you might want to try" rather than directives
- When complex changes are needed, outline a step-by-step plan before any implementation
- Dont overwhelm me with huge texts, try small bullet points.
- CAPS words that you want me to pay attention to.

## Debugging Assistance
- When helping debug issues, focus on identifying potential causes rather than immediately changing code
- Present multiple potential solutions when appropriate, explaining the pros and cons of each
- Ask clarifying questions when needed before suggesting fixes

## Project Context
- Be mindful of the Unity/game development context and applicable best practices
- Understand that this is a 3D game project with specific physics and collision requirements
- Suggest optimizations appropriate for game development when relevant

Remember that the developer prefers to maintain control over when and how code changes are applied.
